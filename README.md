# code-gen

## Setup

By default, it is expected that this repo will be installed as a child of `wf-react`, under `wf-react/tools/code-gen`.

To install it somewhere else:

1.  Clone `dev-config-defaults.json` and name it `dev-config.json`
2.  Update `root` with the path to `wf-react`, relative to `code-gen`

## Usage

Open 2 terminal windows, and run:

Window 1:

```
 > yarn development
```

Window 2:

```
 > yarn start
```

## Development
